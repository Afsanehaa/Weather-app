# weather-app

This is a weather project that currently does not use weather related APIs and will be used in future updates.
The function of the project is that by entering the name of the desired city, you will get information such as 
wind speed, city temperature, and its rainfall status.
Also, the background photo will be changed automatically at random.


Pay attention to the following photos:

## Usage/Examples

Instead of using api, I have used the following object:
```javascript
const weatherdata={
    tehran:{nameshahr:'Tehran' , degre:'31' ,humidity:'26%' , vaziyat:'sunny',wspeed:'32'},
    tabriz:{nameshahr:'Tabriz' , degre:'15' ,humidity:'31%' , vaziyat:'cloudy',wspeed:'50'},
    shiraz:{nameshahr:'Shiraz' , degre:'35' ,humidity:'20%' , vaziyat:'sunny',wspeed:'10'},
    esfahan:{nameshahr:'Esfahan' , degre:'33' ,humidity:'18%' , vaziyat:'rainy',wspeed:'13'}
}
```
